**Uni-Timer Version 1.0.3 released.**  It contains the ability to save credentials for multiple wifi access points to allow easy switching, and also adjustable auto restart delay for practice flights:

**Bluetooth Audio option being evaulated.**  Sends audio to a bluetooth speaker.  Tested successfully with a new version of the Uni-Timer circuit board, but it requires that the speaker supports Bluetooth 5.  It should also be able to be retrofitted to older Uni-timer and CD units.

## Process for updating firmware from Version 1.0.3 to Version 1.0.5 ##
Note that Version 1.0.4 was an internal release only for testing - so it was skipped in the public releases

**1. Get the files:**

* Download the zip file: Uni_timer v1.0.5.zip (select the zip file and then select Download).
* Save the zip file to your computer and unpack it to a convenient location.
* The zip contains the following files:
  * 11 x .mp3 files (e.g. 1_laps.mp3, 2_laps.mp3, etc)
  * F3X_UniTimer.v1.0.5.bin (this is the actual firmware file)

**2. Load the new support files:**

* Start Uni-Timer and in a web browser open the Uni-Timer IP address (as shown on the Uni-Timer display)
* From the web page select "Upload new support file"
* Select "Choose file" and find the 1_laps.mp3 file downloaded earlier
* Select Upload. The file will be loaded to Uni-Timer and "Upload OK" should be displayed in the browser
* Use the back arrow in your browser to go back to the Support file Upload page
* Repeat the upload process for the other ten .mp3 files 

**3. Upload and apply the firmware file:**

Use the browser back arrow to return to the first web page
* Select "Upload new firmware file"
* Select "Choose file" and find the F3X_UniTimer.v1.0.5.bin file
* Select Update. The file will be uploaded to Uni-Timer (this will take about 20 seconds) after which the Uni-Timer will restart


The upgrade is complete.

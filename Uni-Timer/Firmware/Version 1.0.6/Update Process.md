## Process for updating firmware from Version 1.0.5 to Version 1.0.6 ##

**1. Get the file:**

* Download the zip file: Uni_timer v1.0.6.zip (select the zip file and then select Download).
* Save the zip file to your computer and unpack it to a convenient location.
* The zip contains the following file:
  * F3X_UniTimer.v1.0.6.bin (this is the actual firmware file)

**2. Upload and apply the firmware file:**

* Start Uni-Timer and in a web browser open the Uni-Timer IP address (as shown on the Uni-Timer display)
* Select "Upload new firmware file"
* Select "Choose file" and find the F3X_UniTimer.v1.0.6.bin file
* Select Update. The file will be uploaded to Uni-Timer (this will take about 20 seconds) after which the Uni-Timer will restart


The upgrade is complete.

Note that if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.0.5, then make sure that you also upload all of the support files provided with the earlier versions.  Support files are typically .mp3, .html or .csv files.  They were included in the previous version upgrades.

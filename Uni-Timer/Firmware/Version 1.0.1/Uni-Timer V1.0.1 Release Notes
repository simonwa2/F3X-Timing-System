Known issues:
1. 	Bluetooth is broken and crashes the system - unit either stops working or restarts.  Bluetooth should not be used with this version.
2.	Wifi setup can be difficult. In configuration mode (when router details are not yet known), the unit operates in AP mode and should be visible as a wifi access point to a mobile phone.  
	It may take a while to be visible and connection may fail.  May requires several attempts to get it to work.
3.	Battery voltage display may not be accurate due to component tolerances.  It be shown over or under value by 0.1 to 0.2V.
4.	Base unit web pages not fully functional.  Loads pages meant for CD unit.

1.	Store multiple wifi router/hotspot details for easy switching

4.	Event management - event, pilot, rounds and flights - using F3XVault.
5.	Anemometer integration
6.	Extend web pages, e.g. pages dedicated for Base units to show flight data
7.	Fix bluetooth

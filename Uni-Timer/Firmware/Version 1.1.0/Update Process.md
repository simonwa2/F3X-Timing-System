## Process for updating firmware from Version 1.0.5 or 1.0.7 to Version 1.1.0 ##

**1. Get the files:**

* Download the zip file: Uni_timer v1.1.0.zip (select the zip file and then select Download).
* Save the zip file to your computer and unpack it to a convenient location.
* The zip contains the following:
  * Support files:
    * 1 x .mp3 file (point.mp3)
    * 14 x .html files
    * 1 x .css file (style.css)
  * Firmware file:
    * F3X_UniTimer.v1.1.0.bin

**2. Load the new support files:**

* Start Uni-Timer and in a web browser open the Uni-Timer IP address (as shown on the Uni-Timer display)
* From the web page select "Upload new support file"
* Select "Choose file" and find the point.mp3 file downloaded earlier
* Select Upload. The file will be loaded to Uni-Timer and "Upload OK" should be displayed in the browser
* Use the back arrow in your browser to go back to the Support file Upload page
* Repeat the upload process for the other support files 

**3. Upload and apply the firmware file:**

Use the browser back arrow to return to the first web page
* Select "Upload new firmware file"
* Select "Choose file" and find the F3X_UniTimer.v1.1.0.bin file
* Select Update. The file will be uploaded to Uni-Timer (this will take about 20 seconds) after which the Uni-Timer will restart
* When the startup screen appears, press and hold the Red button until Factory Reset appears on the screen.  The unit will apply the default value and start up.


The upgrade is complete.


Note that if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.0.5, then make sure that you also upload all of the support files provided with the earlier versions.  Support files are typically .mp3, .html or .csv files.  They were included in the previous version upgrades.

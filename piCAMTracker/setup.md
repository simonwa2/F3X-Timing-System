This section deals with setting up piCAMTracker with the pi Hat installed and connecting to one of the F3X timing system units (CD, Team or UniTimer).

The picam unit, as supplied, is configured for testing done in Western Australia and needs configuring for your local wifi and country specific settings (keyboard, language, timezone etc).

The initial configuration requies you to connect a mouse (USB), keyboard (USB) and monitor (HDMI). A TV could be used if you don't have a computer monitor.

One the unit has been connected to your home wifi, then it wil be possible to remotely connect to it using VNC Viewer on your computer.  The mouse, keyboard and monitor are then no longer required.

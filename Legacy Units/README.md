The units in these pages are no longer in production,but they are supported for upgrade to the ESP-NOW radio link via a plug-in module.

### Uni-Timer
Cutdown version of CD unit.  Provides announcements for
countdowns, turn signals and flight time.  Links to base units for
completely wireless operation (and audio and wind in the near future). 
Only has a small screen, but provides web pages for extending
capability to smart phones.

### Repeater (Xbee version)
Range extender for the local network that links the units.  Placed on a pole near the centre of the course.   Only necessary where the terrain is hilly and the bases do not have clear line of sight of the course center.

### Audio
Replaced by UniTimer V2.  Wireless audio with line out for connecting to a powered speaker.

### Team
The Team unit is designed primarily for F3B.  It provides flight data to support the distance and duration tasks. It can also act as Base A - reducing the number of people required to run the distance task.  The unit also works as a basic F3F timer (no data storage).
